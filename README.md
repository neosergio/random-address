# Random Address

This is a tool to retrieve a real address from a list of real of random addresses that geocode successfully (tested on Google's Geocoding API service). The address data comes from the OpenAddresses project, and all the addresses are in the public domain. The addresses are deliberately not linked to people or businesses; the only guarantee is that they are real addresses that geocode successfully.

The addresses were pulled from OpenAddress where the "Required attribute" field was present and not "Yes". See "Attribution" below for a list of sources (also included in each data file).

This project was inspired by [Real, Random Address Data (RRAD)](https://github.com/EthanRBrown/rrad) project.

## Installation

Run the following to install:

```bash
$ pip install random-address
```

## Usage

```python
from random_address import real_random_address

# Generate a dictionary with valid random address information
real_random_address()
```

There are other 2 other functions that can be used:
```python
>>> import random_address
>>> random_address.real_random_address_by_state('CA')
{'address1': '37600 Sycamore Street', 'address2': '', 'city': 'Newark', 'state': 'CA', 'postalCode': '94560', 'coordinates': {'lat': 37.5261943, 'lng': -122.0304698}}
>>> random_address.real_random_address_by_postal_code('32409')
{'address1': '711 Tashanna Lane', 'address2': '', 'city': 'Southport', 'state': 'FL', 'postalCode': '32409', 'coordinates': {'lat': 30.41437699999999, 'lng': -85.676568}}
```




**Expected value example:**

```
{'address1': '210 Beachcomber Drive', 'address2': '', 'city': 'Pismo Beach', 'state': 'CA', 'postalCode': '93449', 'coordinates': {'lat': 35.169193, 'lng': -120.694434}}
```
